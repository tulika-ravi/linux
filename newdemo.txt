1. How to check a process running with full path information?
-> ps -ef

2. Using vi editor, how to globally replace a string?
-> vi filename.txt
      (press i for insertion process)
      :%s/old_string/new_string
            :wq(if u wanna save this) 
                   OR
            :q!(if you dont wanna save it and wanna force exit)

3. How to search for a string in all files under a folder and sub-folders?

4. How to remove control-m characters? Refer file /home/srinivasan.r/unix/ctrlm.txt on agni server which contains these characters. 
-> cd (paste the path)
   ls
   vi filename(e.g.,ctrlm.txt)
      :%s/^M//g
         :q!(since its just a read file)

5. How to redirect the output of a command to a file output.txt and errors to another file errors.txt ?
-> touch output.txt (create two files of names output.txt and errors.txt)
   touch errors.txt (create two files of names output.txt and errors.txt)
   command-name > output.txt 2> errors.txt

6. How to redirect the output of a command and append to the file? 
-> cat file1_name>>file2_name (double arrows ">>" are used for appending and single arrow">" is used for overwriting)

7. How to redirect STDERR to STDOUT? 
-> my_name =a 2>command_error.txt
   cat command_error.txt(will give output as "command not found" as this is the error that will be given by the system as my_name=a is not a valid command)

8. How to find memory usage on a unix system 
-> free
     {free -m(if u want it to be displayed in megabyte)

-> bash waitforever.sh
   ^Z (to stop the process)
   bg
   ^C
   fg

13. How do you know how much disk is available? 
-> df
   df -H(for human understandable language)

14. What is the difference between kill -9 and just kill 
-> "kill" command sends a signal to terminate any process gracefully. Hence this is safe.
   "kill -9” command sends a signal to terminate any process forcefully. Hence this is unsafe.

15. What permissions chmod 710 on a directory do? 
-> it sets persmission so that user can read,write or execute.
   7->user      ->read-write-execute->rwx
   1->group     ->execute           ->--x
   0->other user->no permission     ->---

16. How to run a process in the background ? How to bring it to the foreground ? 
-> sleep 100 &
      fg %(process id)
      bg %(process id) it will start running in background

Commands to practice (a single command as long as possible) :

1* List number of files in a directory    ...
->[Ans.:ls -l   ]
   and count lines in each file    
->[Ans.:wc -l filename.java (_or_) wc filename.java]

2* Find the files which are 5 days older  ...
->[Ans.:  ]
   and then zip them      
->[Ans.:zip -r newName.zip directoryName  ]

3* read a file and replace 10th appearance of the word "the" to "abc" and write the output in another file   
->[Ans.:  ]

4* list of 5 largest files from any directory       
->[Ans.:ps -eo pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%mem | head   ]

5* find out the available memory on the server, how long the server has been up and top 5 processes taking max memory of the 
   server 
->[Ans.:grep MemTotal /proc/meminfo  ]   

6* find out the pid of the process        ...
->[Ans.:ps aux  ]
   and kill the process gracefully/forcefully       
->[Ans.:kill -15 27707   ...here 27707 is PID  ]

7* find out how many users are connected to port 22 on a server      
->[Ans.:netstat -anp | grep 22 | wc -l     ]

8* copy a file from one server to another (using scp)      
->[Ans.: server to local m/c: scp tulika.ravi@10.76.139.50:/home/tulika.ravi/test/newdemo.txt .  (and)
    local m/c to server : scp /c/Users/tulika.ravi/desktop/newdemo.txt tulika.ravi@10.76.139.50:/home/tulika.ravi/test      ] ]





Script to write ->
1. write a bash script to print the the present working directory along with its list of files inside
   The current working Directory ->
   The list of files and Subdirectories ->
->vi 1ndQue.sh
		#! /usr/bin/bash
		echo The current working directory:;
		pwd;
		echo The list of files present in current directory:;
		ls;
		echo Files present in the subdirectory present in current directory:;
		ls -d;
		echo the files present in subduirectory are :;
		ls */;
	./1ndQue.sh
	ls -l
	chmod +x 1ndQue.sh
	./1ndQue.sh

2. write a bash script to print with tab delimited first 50 Fibonacci numbers in reverse directions
->vi fib.sh
     #! /bin/bash
first=0
second=1
count=0
count2=0
num=50
rev=0
while [ $count -le $num ]
do
  fib=$(( $first + $second ))
 if [ $num -eq $count ]
  then
    while [ $num -ge $count2 ]
      do
        rev=$(( $second - $first ))
        echo $rev
        second=$first
        first=$rev
        let count2++
      done
  fi
first=$second
second=$fib
let count++
done
:wq
./fib.sh
chmod +x fib.sh
./fib.sh


3. write a bash script which takes a line as input and then print the same line in capital letters
-> vi 3rdQue.sh
		name='hello vinayak, how are you?'
		echo ${name^^}
	./3rdQue.sh
	chmod +x 3rdQue.sh
	./3rdQue.sh
